<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the previous exercises you used the interactive Udemy interface to write your code. For this exercise, please use your computer tools (Python, editor, terminal, etc.). This will help you get used with Python in a real environment. <br></p>

<p>These exercises are difficult and sometimes tricky and I don't expect students to solve them all. The main point of the exercises is to force you to think about how to solve a problem independently. The solution for each exercise is in the next lecture. Don't worry if your solution is not exactly the same as mine. As far as the solutions generate the same output, your solution is most likely correct.<br></p>

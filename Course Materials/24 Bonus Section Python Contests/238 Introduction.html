You can submit your own program in the Q&amp;A section. Every week I select the winning app and I upload a video in this section. In the video I review the code of the app and explain what could be improved. </p><p>If you want to be part of the contest, below are the steps you need to follow:</p><p><em>Step 1</em>: Build a Python program on your own <strong>or</strong> improve one of the existing programs covered in The Python Mega Course. </p><p><em>Step 2</em>: Save the source files on Github, Bitbucket, Dropbox, <strong>or</strong> on any other sharable cloud service. </p><p><em>Step 3</em>: Create a question in the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-python-mega-course/learn/v4/questions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Q&amp;A section inside the course</a>, and submit the link where your files can be downloaded from, <strong>and </strong>also write a few lines describing what the program does.</p><p>Then, just be on the lookout for an email from me by the end of the week where I will announce the winning app, and give you the link to the code review video where I review the code of the app.</p></p>
